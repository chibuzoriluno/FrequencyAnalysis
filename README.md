# FrequencyAnalysis
This program, written in java, is designed to obtain a cipher text in a string, count the number of times each character shows up in the string and print to screen. It does this with the help of a hashmap.
Next it builds another hashmap, or a substitution map, using the data provided through the console in order to decrypt the cipher text.
Every decryption attempt is stored as the new cipher text and printed to screen until the user is satisfied, so as to allow for a step by step approach. This is made possible through the use of a do-while loop.
